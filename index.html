            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I've lived across the US but call the Pacific Northwest my home. Originally born in Virginia, I grew up
                in Missouri, went to school in Texas and, finally landed in South Carolina when I started college. After
                nine years I moved to Oregon and shortly to Washington after meeting my late wife. I had working stints
                in Texas and California since then.</p>
                <p>Most of my work experience has been in logistics and transportation which started when I enlisted in the
                Marine Corps as a logistics specialist. Most of my adult career after college was with various railroads
                but I did work as a port manager for a year. I most recently did a career change into IT starting off as
                a data center technician. I’ve also had short stints running a restaurant and a video game store.</p>
                <p>Aside from work I love to spend time outside on my paddleboard or riding one of my three bikes. I also
                enjoy hiking and I’m trying to get into backpacking more. I hope to be able to work remotely someday and
                travel often.</p>
            <h2>Career Goals</h2>
            <p>I stated to learn coding six years ago but wasn't able to commit to it full time because of work constraints. I eventually switched to learning IT and spent the last year and half working in a data center and going to school for cloud computing.</p>
            <p>With my current commitment to Code Fellows I am hoping to not only achieve what I previously sought out but combine my knowledge of IT and cloud operations. I am considering paths into being either a cloud developer or solutions architect.</p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <Li>I graduated from the Marine Military Academy in 2003. It's the only Marine Corps based high school
                    and is located in Harlingen, TX.</Li>
                <li>I graduated from The Citadel in 2010. It's South Carolina's only remaining military college and is
                    located in Charleston, SC. I was a Marine reservist while I was in school and had to leave on a
                    number of occasions for active duty service. I started with a degree</li>
                <li>I started attending Western Governors University's Cloud Computing degree in 2022 as it was paid for
                    by my employer. As I'm no longer with that
                    employer I've put off the classes until I'm finished with Code Fellows but will continue with
                    certifications which will give me class credit. I plan to finish no later than the end of 2024</li>
